# BIN sponsors for global reach 

For these regions, one partner is enough to cover the majority of countries: Europe, and North America.

For these regions, there is no single partner that covers most countries, so several partners will be required: Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa, and especially Asia-Pacific.
