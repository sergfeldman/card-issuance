**About Ubiquity** 

Ubiquity is a funded startup building highly automated bounties & freelance marketplace, as well as financial services. 

Our target audience is freelancers - individuals (not businesses) that are located in different countries across the globe. 

We share the Alchemy Pay goal to bridge fiat and crypto global economies seamlessly.
Ubiquity helps to earn in Web3 and spend everywhere.

Ideally, we are looking for a strategic partner for long-term cooperation that can begin with the branded card issuing.

**1. Do you require any specialized solutions outside of the standard on/off ramping? (e.g. custom coin listing, custom blockchain, bespoke solutions, etc.)**

We need to issue branded Visa or MasterCard cards for freelancers and perform payouts to these cards.

First of all, we want to perform a quick launch with the basic functionality without specialized solutions.
API for typical actions will be required for this step. 
As we understand, Alchemy Pay can provide white-label virtual debit  MasterCard cards branded by Ubiquity.  

In the future, we plan to develop capabilities for suitable DeFi management and advanced security. 
Alchemy Pay off-ramp solution and partnership with DeFi protocols can be a good foundation for these new capabilities. 

**2. What are some important regions or payment methods that you require?**

The goal is to provide a global Ubiquity card. 
We can start with these regions - Asia (ig Singapore and South Korea),  South America (ig Brazil), and Eastern Europe (ig Poland).
We want to serve countries where freelancers are located, except all jurisdictions included in the FATF black and gray lists, Russia, Belarus.

The preferable payment methods are Visa and MasterCard as we need to perform payouts to freelancers to their cards. 

**3. What about the monthly transaction volume you are expecting after integration?
The amounts you would like to release on the customer side?**

As Ubiquity is a startup, we will grow our user base and volume over time.
In the first months after the integration we expect a monthly transaction volume of about several thousand USD per month, in 1 year - about 100,000 USD per month.

**4. When are you looking to integrate?**

We can start the integration in the nearest future and want to issue cards in Autumn 2023.
